This is a MVC application in .NET 8. The business idea is to fetch Ip address details using and external endpoint (ip-api.com/<some-ip-address>) and return the json response as below screenshot.

To be solved:

1. Fix/Apply comments on the code.
2. Error handling to ensure no exception will be thrown with any user inputs.
3. Make code generic.
